## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  1. Vehicle Length 
  2. Ground Clearance
  
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  No because of the variable have different numbers, therefore it is not a flat line. 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  The p-value is much lower than .05 and the multiple R-Squared is .7, therefore we can determine that future data points are likely to follow the linear model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

  Currently the manufactoring lots in total meet this design specification with a mean variance of 62.3. However, Manufactoring Lot 3 has a mean variance in PSI's of 170.2.
