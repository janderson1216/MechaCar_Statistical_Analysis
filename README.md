## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  1. Vehicle Length 
  2. Ground Clearance
  
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

  No because of the variable have different numbers, therefore it is not a flat line. 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  The p-value is much lower than .05 and the multiple R-Squared is .7, therefore we can determine that future data points are likely to follow the linear model.
